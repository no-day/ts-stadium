## Recepies

### Getting started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/no-day/fp-ts-library-template
mv fp-ts-library-template your-lib-name
cd your-lib-name
yarn install
```

Replace `fp-ts-library-template` with `your-lib-name` in those files:

- `src/index.ts`
- `package.json`

### Build distribution files

```shell
yarn build
```

### Run test suite

```shell
yarn test
```

### Generate Docs

```shell
yarn docs
```

### Preview Docs

You need to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on your system.
Then run

```shell
yarn docs-preview
```

They'll be served at port `4000`

### Enhance README with auto generations

```shell
yarn md
```

### Make docs available online via GitHub pages

- Push to your remote repo at GitHub (triggers CI)
- In the GitHub UI of your repo, go to "Settings" > "GitHub Pages"
- Select `gh-pages` branch as source, keep the "root" directory and "Save"

### Publish to NPM

Only once:

- In the GitHub UI add `NPM_TOKEN` from you NPM account as a secret ("Settings" / "Secrets")

On every release:

- Increase the version in the `package.json` e.g. to "1.0.1"
- Commit as `v1.0.1`
- In the GitHub UI, go to the "releases" section of your repo.
- Select "Create a new release"
- Use `v1.0.1` as "Tag version" and "Release title"
- Click "Publish release"
- Check the "Actions" tab to see if CI runs properly
